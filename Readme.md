## Installation

To install this plugin on your application, using the terminal, `cd` to your app's directory and type:

```shell
selenia module:install-plugin
```

and select `selenia-plugins/admin-interface` from the displayed list, or type

```shell
selenia module:install-plugin selenia-plugins/admin-interface
```

or type

```shell
composer require selenia-plugins/admin-interface
```

### Required configuration settings

The default bundled administration pages require some settings to be configured.

> If you don't use these pages on your app, you don't need to set these settings.

* `languages =` [ *array of language definitions* ]
* `requireLogin = true`
* `globalSessions` (optional)

The admin interface is multilingual (even if you use just one language on your app), and this plugin enables translation support by default.

> If you have overriden that setting on your app's configuration, you'll need to enable it or create a sub-configuration to enable it for the chosen URI prefix.

You'll need to define, at least, one language on the app's configuration and select a default language on the  `.env` file.

##### Example

On `private/config/application.ini.php`

```php
return [
  'main' => [
    'languages'           => [
      'en:en-US:English:en_US|en_US.UTF-8|us',
      'pt:pt-PT:PortuguÃªs:pt_PT|pt_PT.UTF-8|ptg',
    ],
    'globalSessions'      => false, // share the session between the application and its sub-applications?
    'requireLogin'        => true,  // require login for this application?
  ]
];
```

On `.env`

```
APP_DEFAULT_LANG  = en
```

## Usage

This plugin integrates into your application's main menu. The bundled pages will appear automatically on it.

If the app does not display the menu, you'll need to navigate manually to the provided URLs to see one of the bundled administration pages.

> Relative URL for the user administration page: `admin/users`

If you want pages on your app to inherit the bundled administration graphical layout and default functionality, you'll need to:

1. make your controller classes inherit from `Selenia\Plugins\AdminInterface\Controllers\AdminController`
2. include on each of your views, as root tag, one of the bundled layout templates (ex: `<Admin>`).

> See the bundled administration pages' source code for concrete examples.
